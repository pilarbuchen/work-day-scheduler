# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code

For this challenge, I made a workday scheduler. The platform holds a daily schedule from 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM. The user will be able to make changes to the text by clicking on it and can save the information by clicking on the locked item. 

## Sections

1. A title with the name of the application and the current date. 

2. A table showing a range of 8 hours, from 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM. 

3. Any past hours will be greyed out, and future hours will be displayed green; the current hour will turn red. 

4. The text is editable by clicking on the box, and when the user presses the save "lock," the text will be saved, and a message will confirm the save at the top of the table.
